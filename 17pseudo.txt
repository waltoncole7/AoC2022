How do I "drop" a piece?

Continually perform step 1 and step 2

piece is one squid. board is another.

Step 1: move to the prescribed side.
    check if the next move has overlaps.
        if not, move every cell to that side.
        if so, do nothing and move o.
step 2: move down
    check if down has overlaps
        if so, STOP EVERYTHING and move on to the next piece
        if not, move everything down.
