order function:
take in list a and list b
return whether they are in the right order (certain, value)

for i in min:
    if both are int:
        if there is a difference:
            return true, a < b
    if one of each:
        turn int to list
    if both are list:
        answer = order(a at i, b at i)
        if answer[0]:
            return true, answer





if both are length 1 and :
    return a < b or if equal, no certainty
else:
    for i in minLength:
        if order(a[i], b[i])[0]:
            return order()[1]
    if lengths arent equal:
        return  len(a) > len(b)



---------Part 2------------

first pass:
move the first value 

[1,2,3]
i=0
j: 0


for every element:
make that element the one we move on this pass
starting at the beginning, check if they are in the right order. If NOT: put it in the spot one previous.

list = [1,2,3,4,5]
i=4
moving = 3
j=1
order(moving, jval) = true
