I can easily find:
sensor locations
beacon locations
closest beacon to each sensor
distance to closest beacon from each sensor

when checking an x and y coordinate, I want to search for the closest sensor, then compare distances only with that sensor.
^wont work because the constraining sensor is not necessarily the closest.

My current approach would have:
part 1: 20 million*32 comparisons
part 2: (4 million)^2 *32 comparisons. <<That's a lot more. 800,000 times more comparisons.
