Breadth-first search?

benefit will be the cumulative gas to be released
priority queue will sort: first, high benefit to low.

(priority, data)
priority = -benefit

for each room in the frontier,
-take it out
-find its neighbors

**How do we determine whether to turn a valve or move past it?


Depth-first search?
work in terms of moves instead of rooms?
"Depth" is really time. Max depth of 30
each move is either turning a valve or moving through a tunnel
this seems better.
